# The Lies Truth
## Grim Fantasy - Complete Story Outline
by Tobias Winkler

---

## Core Concept

The protagonist is a coma patient whose mind has created (or escaped into) a dream world. The game follows their journey through this world, culminating in a choice: REBELLION (destroy the dream to wake up) or ACCEPTANCE (embrace the dream forever, body never wakes).

A hidden "rebellion counter" tracks player choices throughout the game. No UI element displays this value. The world visually shifts based on the counter - rebellion skews eerie and frightening, acceptance skews colourful and inviting.

## Biome Structure

### Biome 1: Suburbs (Chapters 1-3)

**Chapter 1 - Awakening**

The protagonist awakens in the middle of a small lawn, laying naked and without knowledge or memory. He has amnesia, doesn't remember where he is, or where he comes from. He gets up and inspects his surroundings - he is in some suburb, but the suburb is void of life. No other people to be seen, no sound of activity, only wind rustling in the leaves. The protagonist gets up and starts exploring, figuring out what happens.

**Chapter 2 - First Contact**

As the protagonist starts exploration, he recognises that he is spied upon and followed by a creature. The creature eventually engages the protagonist and introduces him to the creatures of the world, and the Watchers - the ones who will seek to destroy everything that stirs up the stasis of this world. The creature eventually befriends the protagonist and volunteers to be employed into his service, so that he can fend for him and protect him, if need be. Very soon after, that is exactly what happens, and a minor Watcher notices the protagonist, engages him in combat, and the creature, now known as Zsar, successfully defeats the Watcher. From thereon, the protagonist and Zsar will be a team, with many other creatures eventually joining his cause as well.

**Chapter 3 - First Flashback**

As the protagonist explores the suburban environment, going through empty homes, finding useful things (better gear for Zsar, a microchip that enables fire casting, potions for health restoration), he eventually comes across a home that triggers a flashback. Brief memories of something that has happened, a glimpse of an idea that there is something beyond this empty ghost land. The protagonist finishes exploring this area and ventures forth into the next area.

**BIOME BOSS: The Sentinel**
A Watcher that has claimed this territory. First real test of combat. Guards the exit to the mountains.

---

### Biome 2: Mountains (Chapters 4-5)

**Chapter 4 - Expansion**

As the protagonist reaches the mountains, he encounters more creatures like Zsar, some of which send him on side quests, others invite him to fight. Next to interesting loot, engaging with these creatures gives the protagonist the chance to employ them for his roster of team options. As he manages more side quests, he starts stirring up the world, which notices him like a body recognises bacteria and slowly starts reacting against him. Parts of the world become actively hostile, and stronger opponents start appearing.

**Chapter 5 - The First Artifact**

The world's immune response escalates. A significant Watcher hunts the protagonist specifically - not a random encounter, but targeted. Exploration yields strange debris: objects that feel out of place - a strip of plastic with faded text, a small card with numbers, fragments that don't match anything in this world. Zsar dismisses them as "debris from beyond, meaningless here" but seems uneasy when the protagonist examines them too closely.

**BIOME BOSS: The Hollow**
A corrupted creature that was once like Zsar, now mindless. Foreshadows what can happen to companions. Guards the exit to the wilds.

---

### Biome 3: The Wilds (Chapters 6-7)

**Chapter 6 - Creature Society**

The protagonist encounters creatures living in loose communities - not hostile, not servants, just existing. This is the first time the world feels like it has a life beyond the protagonist. Some creatures here are clearly suffering from corruption/decay - a form of cancer eating at the world.

**Key choice zone:** Help the sick creatures (acceptance) or harvest them for power (rebellion). Neither is explicitly labeled.

Zsar's commentary shifts based on prior choices:
- Neutral Zsar: Explains both options
- Worried Zsar: Pleads for compassion
- Hardened Zsar: Stays quiet

**Chapter 7 - The Dreamer's Echo**

Deep in the wilds, the protagonist finds a location that shouldn't exist - a clearing that looks exactly like a strange room, rendered in the world's aesthetic. A bed-like structure, vine-wrapped shapes that could be machines, tubes of bark and stone. A figure lies in the bed. It looks like... the protagonist? Or something wearing his shape?

Flashback intensifies: fragments of something. Screeching. Impact. Voices shouting.

The protagonist wakes from the vision. Zsar is terrified but refuses to explain. "Some places show things that aren't meant to be understood. We should leave." The world trembles. The protagonist knows something is deeply wrong, but the meaning remains out of reach.

**BIOME BOSS: The Rot Mother**
Source of the corruption in this biome.
- Acceptance players: Heal her
- Rebellion players: Destroy her
Same fight, different narrative framing. Guards the exit to the ruins.

---

### Biome 4: The Ruins (Chapters 8-9)

**Chapter 8 - The World Speaks**

The ruins are the world's oldest place - where previous intruders left their marks. Graffiti, damage, scars. The world has survived this before.

Here, the world speaks directly to the protagonist for the first time - not through Watchers or creatures, but as a voice. It speaks in riddles and half-truths:

*"You came from somewhere else. So did others before you. Some tried to leave. Some chose to stay. The ones who left... I do not know what became of them. The ones who stayed became part of me. You must choose, but I cannot tell you what lies beyond. I only know what is here."*

**The player never learns the full truth.** Hints accumulate - the hospital artifacts, the flashbacks, the strange echoes - but the world never explicitly reveals that this is a coma. The protagonist (and player) must make their choice based on fragments and instinct, not full understanding.

Zsar's reaction depends on the counter:
- Acceptance-leaning: "This can be your home. We can be your family."
- Rebellion-leaning: "I knew you would never stay. I hoped I was wrong."

**Chapter 9 - Consequences Crystallize**

The world reacts to the protagonist's trajectory - not his understanding, but his actions.

**Rebellion path:** The ruins become hostile. Creatures the protagonist helped earlier turn against him. Watchers multiply. The world fights desperately, though the protagonist doesn't know why it fears him so much. Zsar stays loyal but grows distant, speaking less, watching more.

**Acceptance path:** The ruins become navigable, almost welcoming. Corruption becomes the primary enemy - the protagonist has become part of the world's defense. Creatures join more readily. Zsar is relieved, affectionate. But occasionally the protagonist glimpses that strange room again - the bed, the shape that looks like him - and feels a pull he can't explain.

**BIOME BOSS: The Echo**
A manifestation of a previous intruder who chose wrong:
- Rebellion players fight: Someone who accepted and became a husk
- Acceptance players fight: Someone who rebelled and left scars
A mirror of your potential future. Guards the exit to the threshold.

### Biome 5: The Threshold (Chapters 10-12)

**Chapter 10 - The Final Approach**

The final zone before the heart. This is where soft-locks happen - certain quests only appear once thresholds are crossed, and accepting them commits further.

**Rebellion path:** A final Watcher, the strongest yet, guards the path. The world throws everything it has left at the protagonist.

**Acceptance path:** The world offers a trial - prove commitment by healing the deepest corruption, which turns out to be a twisted, cancerous version of the protagonist's own memories - the trauma of the accident made manifest.

**Chapter 11 - The Betrayal (REBELLION ONLY)**

The protagonist declares his choice to strike against this world and end it, accepting the consequences thereof. Since this means the end of everything, including the creatures, Zsar cannot venture further and chooses to make a stand against the protagonist.

The fight is short. Zsar is trivially easy to defeat - not a boss, not a challenge. Just a loyal friend who knew he couldn't win and stood in the way anyway. The end is quick and very sad. A long companion is dead, the only source of morale and truth in this world.

No glory. No challenge. Just a choice and its consequence.

**BIOME BOSS:**
- Rebellion: The Last Watcher - the world's final guardian, everything it has left
- Acceptance: Trauma Incarnate - the protagonist's own damage made manifest

**Chapter 12 - The Heart**

**REBELLION:**
The protagonist ventures into the heart of the realm, engaging the physical manifestation of the world - the Avatar, the major antagonist of the entire journey. After the Avatar is struck down, the protagonist sees it was protecting something - a pulsing core, the heart of everything. Since the Avatar is just that - an avatar - it cannot be entirely killed. The protagonist has only seconds until the fight restarts. He rushes towards the heart. The world pleads in a voice full of terror. His remaining creatures split - some try to stop him, loyal to this place they call home; others fight alongside him, wanting whatever lies beyond. All the protagonist's friends and servants kill each other to the very last, until all are dead. Then the protagonist stands before the heart, strikes against it, and everything fades to white.

**ACCEPTANCE:**
The protagonist enters the heart as the world's chosen champion. The Avatar awaits - not as an enemy, but as a final test of worthiness. The fight is ritual combat, almost ceremonial, the world letting the protagonist win as proof of strength. After the Avatar falls, the protagonist approaches the heart. Instead of destruction, he feels warmth. Welcome. He merges with it, becoming the new Avatar - eternal guardian of this place. It feels like coming home.

### Epilogue (Chapter 13)

**This is the only moment the truth is revealed.**

**REBELLION:**
The screen fades. The world is gone. Then: fluorescent lights. Beeping monitors. The protagonist wakes up in an ER, gasping. A terrible accident. Doctors rushing. He is alive. 

Only now does the player understand: it was a coma. Everything - Zsar, the creatures, the world itself - was a dream. He chose to destroy it without ever knowing what he was destroying, or what he was waking up to. The cost was everything, and he didn't even know.

**ACCEPTANCE:**
The protagonist becomes the new Avatar, guardian of this eternal dreamscape. Peace. Belonging. The game ends.

Cut to: fluorescent lights. Beeping monitors. A body lies in a hospital bed. Family members sit nearby, exhausted. A doctor speaks quietly: "There's no change. We need to discuss options."

Only now does the player understand: the protagonist will never wake up. He chose eternal dream without knowing he was choosing eternal coma. His family will eventually have to let go of a body that breathes but will never return.

**The player chose without knowing. That's the point.**

## Key Design Notes

### The Rebellion Counter
- Hidden from player (no UI)
- Each quest affects counter by varying amounts (not binary)
- Killing Zsar should be the largest single rebellion spike - point of no return
- Visual world state reflects counter: rebellion = eerie/frightening, acceptance = colourful/inviting
- Gradual shift - players shouldn't notice moment-to-moment, but early vs late screenshots should be striking

### Zsar's Role
- Acts as the morality/voice of the world
- Starter companion - players bond with him first
- His dialogue shifts based on counter state
- His concern escalates as rebellion grows
- His death (if chosen) is deliberately anticlimactic - not a boss fight, just murder

### Enemy Sources by Path
**Rebellion:** Watchers (immune system attacking intruder)
**Acceptance:** Corruption/decay (cancer to be fought) + Rogue Watchers (immune system overreacting)

### Watchers
Manifestations of the world's immune system. Distinct from the Avatar, which is the world's conscious representative.

### Thematic Core
The player never learns the truth until the game ends. Hints accumulate - strange artifacts, unsettling visions, cryptic warnings - but the full picture is withheld. The player must choose rebellion or acceptance based on instinct and fragments, not understanding.

The inversion hits twice:
1. The pleasant gameplay experience (acceptance) leads to the tragic ending (eternal coma)
2. The player only understands what they chose *after* they've already chosen it

Players who min-max for comfort get punished narratively. Players who chose brutality learn they murdered their friend to escape a dream they didn't know was a dream.

## Open Questions

- Creature reactions after Zsar's death - do some leave the party?
- Specific quest designs for each biome
- Detailed creature roster and evolution paths
- How flashbacks are mechanically triggered
- Specific artifacts/clues found in each biome (must remain ambiguous - never explicitly medical)
- What the "outside world" artifacts actually look like in the game's aesthetic
