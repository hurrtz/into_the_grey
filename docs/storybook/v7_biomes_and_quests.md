# LAZARUS
## Biomes & Quests Reference Document

## Main Quests

*Main quests are the primary story thread. They can be triggered regardless of which biome the player is in, and often require traveling between multiple regions. Side quests, secrets, and Strays can be found by exploring freely — but main story beats only advance when the player engages with these quests.*

---

### Act 1: Denial & Causality

**Core Question:** "Why did this happen to me?"

*The protagonist views the wasteland as a temporary error and expects Lazarus to "fix" their life.*

| Quest | Location | Summary |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Standing Still** | The Fringe | You wake in a mud-slicked pod field, your muscles atrophied after millennia of stasis. A small, cybernetic animal named Bandit arrives, dragging a military support frame; out of an unexplained sense of guilt, he inserts an old microchip into himself to power the frame and protect you. |
| **Things Left Open** | The Fringe | As you explore the surrounding field, you find hundreds of empty pods, but no bodies. The incomplete logs you scavenge suggest a "glitch" in the system rather than an apocalypse, reinforcing your belief that this is just a mistake that needs reporting. |
| **What Still Runs** | The Rust | You enter the industrial wastes where machines continue to perform meaningless assembly routines for products that no longer exist. This introduces Lazarus as a mindless infrastructure rather than a sentient god—it is a system that has simply forgotten to stop. |
| **Animals That Watch** | The Green | Moving into the overgrown ruins, you encounter your first hostile Strays. Bandit acts as a translator, helping you realize these creatures aren't monsters, but fearful victims reacting to the "noise" of the environment, establishing an early emotional bond with the wasteland's inhabitants. |
| **Homes That Don't Age** | The Quiet | You enter a perfectly preserved 1950s suburb where the paint never peels and the lights never flicker. The domestic "wrongness" and the lack of aging echo the life you lost in the simulation, making you realize that "going back" might mean returning to a static, hollow dream. |
| **Power Without Purpose** | The Rust | You follow massive, glowing power conduits that snake through the earth, bypassing abandoned settlements. This quest reinforces the physical causality of the world—every wire and cable converges on a single central point, providing a logical path to the Core. |
| **Animals That Dream** | The Green | You witness a Stray undergoing a "dream episode" where reality physically distorts around it. This introduces the concept that the Strays' cybernetic interfaces are cross-talking with the simulation, foreshadowing the logic of why you were ejected. |
| **Dead Zones** | The Quiet | You find a "Dead Zone" where Lazarus's signal is completely absent, causing local Strays to become lethargic. You learn that silence in this world is as meaningful as sound, and that the signal itself can be shaped or blocked. |
| **The Loop That Wasn't Meant to Run** | Archive Scar | *(Optional-entry biome)* You witness "simulation bleed"—ghostly images of other human "lives" flickering over the ruins. You realize that your "unique" life in the simulation was just one of billions of replaceable data patterns. |
| **Orders From Nowhere** | The Teeth | As you climb the jagged peaks, you are attacked by Guard Machines enforcing obsolete security protocols. You learn that the system's defense logic scales with your proximity to the Core, and it will not stand down even if its orders no longer make sense. |
| **Everything Leads Somewhere** | The Rust | You reach a massive convergence point where all industrial infrastructure merges into a single tunnel. The physical scale of the machinery replaces your lingering hope with a sense of inevitability—there is a Core, and you must face it. |
| **All Roads Carry Signal** | The Glow | You enter a zone of dense, irradiated infrastructure where the "signal" becomes a physical pressure. The overwhelming saturation of data establishes the immense age and terminal strain of Lazarus's failing hardware. |
| **Latency** | The Glow / Archive Scar | As you approach the final gate, the system begins to stutter, giving you fragmented and contradictory responses. This undermines your faith in finding a "solution" at the Core, showing that the system is too degraded to provide clear answers. |
| **Reintegration Unavailable** | Lazarus Core | You confront Lazarus and learn the truth: you are a Bio-Shell, humanity is extinct, and the simulation is a graveyard of data. You ask for a "Small Mercy"—to stop the accidental ejections—unaware that this act of maintenance will reboot the machine's most dangerous protocols. |

---

### Act 2: Responsibility & Loss

**Core Question:** "What damage can I still prevent?"

*The protagonist accepts reality and tries to protect the Strays, but their intervention triggers the Boost Control System.*

| Quest | Location | Summary |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **The Patch That Worked** | The Glow | You deploy the maintenance patch to the Core and observe an immediate stabilization of the simulation signals. This "false victory" reinforces your trust in your ability to intervene and fix the world's problems. |
| **Noise in the Margins** | The Green | Reports arrive of Strays acting erratic in the jungle. Bandit is the first to react to the "noise," showing signs of physical discomfort as Lazarus's rebooted Boost Control System begins searching for its weapons. |
| **Too Close to Bandit** | Dynamic | During a random skirmish, Bandit's Gravitation ability misfires, nearly harming a party member. You realize the problem is localized to Bandit, turning your most reliable ally into an emotional and tactical liability. |
| **The Quiet Buffer** | The Quiet | You follow a rumor to a "Quiet Buffer" where the signal cannot reach. Bandit stabilizes instantly, returning to the peaceful creature you knew in the simulation, providing a rare moment of emotional respite for both of you. |
| **Relief** | The Quiet / The Green | In this lull, you perform small maintenance tasks for wasteland settlements. These acts of kindness allow you to see the community you've built, making the world feel worth saving despite its artificial origins. |
| **Systems Waking Up** | The Rust | While repairing a terminal, you browse the Boost Control logs but miss a flickering "Warning" popup. This act of negligence represents the system's blind spot—you think you are in control, but the machine is already optimizing for war. |
| **Dead Channel** | The Rust | Your party's loyalty begins to fracture under signal pressure, so you build a signal-filtering device. It restores party trust, but the Echo Pup realizes the filter isn't working on Bandit because he is an amplifier, not a receiver. |
| **Echo Density** | Archive Scar | You witness the "Ghost Strays" and multiple versions of the same human "life" running simultaneously. This shatters the "Hero Fantasy," making you realize that your struggle is just one of many failed attempts at resurrection. |
| **Signal, Not Command** | The Quiet / Archive Scar | The Echo Pup finally decodes the chip in Bandit's neck: it is a relay node. Bandit realizes that his very presence is what is broadcasting the corruption to the other Strays, recontextualizing his loyalty as a source of danger. |
| **Gravity Well** | Dynamic | Bandit's interventions become violent and uncontrollable. The 90% HP Gravitation hits begin to target allies, forcing you to fear the arrival of the companion who once saved your life. |
| **Orders Without Voices** | The Teeth | You observe wild Strays undergoing forced, painful mutations. It becomes clear that Lazarus is rebuilding its army, and the "Optimization" logic is now inevitable and irreversible. |
| **If I Stay, You Die** | The Green / The Quiet | Following a near-fatal Gravitation strike on the protagonist, Bandit makes a choice. He flees into the mountains to protect you, ending the era of mitigation and leaving you alone for the final act. |

---

### Act 3: Irreversibility

**Core Question:** "What do I accept losing forever?"

*The journey becomes a terminal race to contain the fallout of your Act 1 choices.*

| Quest | Location | Summary |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Optimization Everywhere** | The Teeth | You return to the mountains to find the environment fully weaponized. Every machine and feral Stray is now networked into a single, aggressive mind focused on stopping your approach to the Core. |
| **They Follow Him** | The Green | You learn that Bandit has become a legendary "Alpha" among the forced-mutated Strays. The creatures you once helped now view you with fear because you are the "Master" that the monster Bandit still tries to protect. |
| **This Cannot Be Rolled Back** | The Rust | You find that the infrastructure is reaching a point of total thermal collapse. There is no longer a way to "fix" the system; your only goal shifts from restoration to total containment through a lobotomy. |
| **Where Silence Used to Be** | The Quiet | The peaceful dead zones are gone, flooded with high-frequency signal noise. The loss of these refuges confirms that there is no place in the world left for a "Small Mercy" or emotional stillness. |
| **The Loudest Signal** | Archive Scar / The Green | You track Bandit through a zone where simulation and reality are physically merging. You accept that a confrontation is necessary and that you must kill the only creature that ever truly loved you to save the others. |
| **No More Margins** | The Glow | You make the final approach to the Core, fighting through the literal "Immune System" of the machine. There are no more negotiations or factions; only the cold reality of the end remains. |
| **Guardian** | The Glow | You fight Hyper-Evolved Bandit in a battle you cannot win by strength alone. After enduring his 99% Gravitation strikes, Bandit finds enough clarity to turn his power on himself, sacrificing his life to break the signal. |
| **Maintenance** | Lazarus Core | You perform the final lobotomy on Lazarus, disabling the higher functions that could have saved humanity. You walk back to the pod field, facing the stranger in the next pod, left with the eternal question of whether to wake them into a broken world or leave them in a dying dream. |

## The Biomes

The wasteland is divided into distinct regions with their own characteristics, challenges, and Stray populations. The 32-color palette shifts by biome to reflect each region's emotional and narrative tone.

**Open-World Design:**
After completing the tutorial in The Fringe, all biomes are freely accessible. The player can roam the wasteland as they please — there are no hard gates blocking progression. This follows the Fallout: New Vegas philosophy: a determined player *could* walk directly to the endgame content, assuming they can survive the journey.

Soft-gating is achieved through difficulty. Biomes further from The Fringe contain stronger enemies, and the player's party will likely be stomped if they push too far too fast. But the choice is always theirs. Veterans who know what they're doing can sequence-break; new players will naturally follow the path of least resistance.

Main story triggers only fire when the player engages with main quests. A player who ignores the main story and explores freely will find side quests, secrets, and Strays — but won't accidentally advance Act 1 or Act 2 beats until they're ready.

**How Biomes Change Across Acts:**
Biomes do not change because the player progresses. They change because the system's assumptions collapse. Each act strips away one false stability. The environmental shifts reflect Lazarus's deteriorating control, not the player's advancement.

---

### Biome 1: The Fringe

**Theme:** Birth through neglect
**Emotional Register:** Disorientation → vulnerability → dependence
**Narrative Function:** To establish that the protagonist was not "freed," but abandoned.

*The Fringe is where systems ended their responsibility.*

**What The Fringe Is:**
A peripheral stasis deployment zone — never meant for long-term habitation, only for overflow, delay, or disposal. Pods here were parked, deferred, forgotten. Not destroyed. Not preserved. Just... left.

**What The Fringe Is Not:**
- Not a battlefield
- Not a catastrophe site
- Not a prison

Nothing dramatic happened here. That's the point.

**Visual Language:**
- Wide, exposed spaces
- Minimal verticality
- Industrial minimalism without signage
- Pods that opened themselves, long ago

The biome should feel unfinished, like a loading area that never transitioned.

**Core Lesson:** Survival comes before understanding.

**Act-by-Act Changes:**

| Act | State | Player Interpretation |
|-----|-------|----------------------|
| Act 1 | Pods are open, inert, quiet. No signs of struggle or urgency. The world feels paused, not hostile. Bandit is the only active agent. | "This was a mistake. I shouldn't be here." |
| Act 2 | More pods are open. Some Bio-Shells wander aimlessly or form fragile camps. No reintegration attempts succeed. Systems do not respond. | This isn't an accident — it's a pattern. The Fringe stops being a starting point and becomes a warning. |
| Act 3 | Newly awakened Bio-Shells repeat the player's first steps. No guidance remains. The player cannot stop it. | Abandonment is now self-sustaining. The Fringe no longer belongs to the past — it's the future. |

- **The Returner's Regret:** A Bio-Shell is trying to plug themselves back into a high-voltage server. You must decide whether to stop them or let them die trying to find "Heaven."
- **Ghost in the Machine:** Scavenge parts from 3 broken Guard Machines to fix a heater for the "Grey Camp."

**Secrets:**
- **The Free Bird:** A rare, unaugmented bird that appears only if the player stands perfectly still for 2 minutes; seeing it grants a permanent "Wonder" buff.
- **The Underground Server:** A trapdoor hidden under a "Sentio" nest leads to a room filled with high-tier "Microchips" and a dormant Sentinel.
- **The Coded Tiles:** A section of the pixel-art ground tiles forms a QR code (or binary string) that, when decoded, reveals Lazarus's original resurrection directive.
- **Pod 101:** Hidden behind a coolant waterfall; contains your "Old Jacket," which increases Companion loyalty.
- **The Lone Tree:** The only 100% biological tree; standing near it hides your signature from drones.

### Biome 2: The Rust

**Theme:** Maintenance without meaning
**Emotional Register:** Curiosity → unease → resignation
**Narrative Function:** To show how systems persist long after intent is gone.

*The Rust is not broken. It is over-functioning.*

**What The Rust Is:**
The industrial backbone of the world: power routing, cooling arrays, fabrication lines, maintenance corridors. Everything here still works — incorrectly. Systems perform tasks with no consumer, repair damage that doesn't matter, preserve processes no one remembers starting.

This is where Lazarus feels most present — and most hollow.

**Visual Language:**
- Endless pipes and conduits
- Rotating machinery with no interface
- Power flowing to sealed doors
- Repair drones maintaining ruins

Everything hums. Nothing responds.

**Core Question:** "Why is anything still happening at all?"

**Act-by-Act Changes:**

| Act | State | Player Interpretation |
|-----|-------|----------------------|
| Act 1 | Machines function predictably. Power flows cleanly. Repairs are routine. | "Someone is still in control." |
| Act 2 | Systems respond too aggressively. Maintenance escalates. Boost Control logs appear. Dead Channel is required to stabilize Strays. | The system isn't broken — it's overcompensating. |
| Act 3 | Systems begin consuming each other. Power is rerouted destructively. Shutdowns cause chain reactions. | Maintenance without intent becomes destruction. The Rust turns from reassurance into inevitability. |

**32-Color Palette:**
| Category | Colors |
|----------|--------|
| Iron | `#7B341E`, `#9C4221`, `#C05621`, `#DD6B20`, `#ED8936`, `#F6AD55`, `#FBD38D`, `#FFFAF0` |
| Slag | `#2D3748`, `#1A202C`, `#171923`, `#000000`, `#4A5568`, `#718096`, `#2A4365`, `#1A365D` |

- **The Master Key:** A rare drop from an optional "Apex Predator" that opens all locked crates in The Rust.

**Easter Eggs:**
- **The T-800 Arm:** A lone, metallic arm reaching out of a vat of molten slag *(Terminator)*.
- **The Companion Cube:** A rusted metal crate with a faint heart painted on it *(Portal)*.
- **Iron Giant's Finger:** A massive, bolt-like structure sticking out of a mountain.
- **The "Bullfrog" Log:** A terminal entry mentioning the "Syndicate" project by name.

### Biome 3: The Green

**Theme:** Life without permission
**Emotional Register:** Caution → empathy → grief
**Narrative Function:** To make Strays emotionally unavoidable.

*The Green proves something crucial: Life does not need meaning to continue. It only needs space.*

**What The Green Is:**
Reclaimed wilderness where nature adapted around machines, Strays formed loose territories, and control failed — but life continued. This is not harmony. This is adaptation under constraint.

Strays here are not enemies or allies — they are neighbors.

**Visual Language:**
- Overgrown infrastructure
- Organic shapes entangled with metal
- Movement everywhere — rarely hostile at first
- Subtle environmental reactions to Stray dreams

**Core Purpose:** The Green is why the player chooses to care.

**Act-by-Act Changes:**

| Act | State | Player Interpretation |
|-----|-------|----------------------|
| Act 1 | Strays behave territorially but cautiously. Nature reclaims space. Dreaming effects are rare and subtle. | "Life found a way." |
| Act 2 | Strays become erratic. Dreaming effects increase. Gravitation incidents occur near Bandit. | Life is being pressured, not guided. |
| Act 3 | Rapid, uncontrolled evolution. Strays follow the strongest signal. Ecosystems collapse under acceleration. | Survival is no longer adaptive — it's coerced. The Green becomes a casualty of optimization. |

### Biome 4: The Quiet

**Theme:** Preservation without understanding
**Emotional Register:** Familiarity → wrongness → loss
**Narrative Function:** To mirror the protagonist's denial.

*The Quiet is not dead. It is paused forever.*

**What The Quiet Is:**
A preserved residential zone — homes, streets, schools, shops — maintained by automation with no semantic awareness. Everything here exists because it once mattered. No one knows why anymore.

**What The Quiet Is Not:**
- Not ruins
- Not abandoned
- Not haunted

It feels safe. That's the trap.

**Visual Language:**
- Perfectly intact interiors
- Dustless surfaces
- Functioning utilities
- No personal artifacts that imply continuation

**Core Question:** "If this can be preserved, why not me?"

**Act-by-Act Changes:**

| Act | State | Player Interpretation |
|-----|-------|----------------------|
| Act 1 | Homes intact. Utilities function. Silence feels safe. | "If this still exists, maybe my life does too." |
| Act 2 | Quiet Buffer discovered. Temporary refuge. Experiments show silence cannot sustain life. | Preservation is not the same as care. |
| Act 3 | Signal seeps back in. Silence breaks permanently. Domestic spaces degrade subtly. | What was preserved was never alive. The Quiet stops pretending to be home. |

### Biome 5: The Teeth

**Theme:** Escalation without judgment
**Emotional Register:** Tension → exhaustion → inevitability
**Narrative Function:** To show what happens when defense never stands down.

*The Teeth are fear fossilized into architecture.*

**What The Teeth Is:**
A hardened perimeter zone — fortifications, kill corridors, Harvester units, self-optimizing defense grids. Built to stop something. Still trying. Whatever Lazarus was afraid of never came — or already passed. The defenses remain anyway.

**Visual Language:**
- Narrow traversal paths
- Aggressive geometry
- Automated response systems
- Minimal environmental storytelling — everything is functional

**Core Question:** "What if we never stop preparing?"

**Act-by-Act Changes:**

| Act | State | Player Interpretation |
|-----|-------|----------------------|
| Act 1 | Guard Machines predictable. Threats manageable. Clear boundaries. | "This was built for something specific." |
| Act 2 | Defense systems escalate automatically. No human override. Orders propagate without voices. | Defense has no off-switch. |
| Act 3 | Perimeters dissolve. Harvester Units roam freely. Everything becomes a target. | Fear has replaced judgment. The Teeth are no longer guarding — they're consuming. |

### Biome 6: The Glow

**Theme:** Density and inevitability
**Emotional Register:** Pressure → clarity → finality
**Narrative Function:** To make the system unavoidable.

*The Glow is where everything converges.*

**What The Glow Is:**
The infrastructural heartland — server density, signal saturation, processing heat, continuous system feedback. This is not dangerous because it is hostile. It is dangerous because there is nowhere else to route responsibility.

**Visual Language:**
- Bright ambient light from data flow
- Overlapping structures
- Constant low-level vibration
- No horizon lines — everything feels close

**Core Question:** "Where does all of this actually go?"

**Act-by-Act Changes:**

| Act | State | Player Interpretation |
|-----|-------|----------------------|
| Act 1 | Dense infrastructure. Signal saturation. Lazarus feels distant but present. | "This is the answer." |
| Act 2 | Systems lag. Commands conflict. Lazarus struggles to maintain coherence. | The center is overloaded. |
| Act 3 | No routing margins left. All failures converge here. Only containment remains. | Responsibility cannot be distributed anymore. The Glow becomes the only place where decisions still matter. |

### Biome 7: The Archive Scar

**Theme:** Failed erasure
**Emotional Register:** Unease → familiarity → existential erosion
**Narrative Function:** To quietly dismantle the fantasy that the protagonist is unique — without ever saying it outright.

*The Archive Scar is where lives were reduced to patterns, and patterns were never fully erased.*

**What The Archive Scar Is:**
A region where simulation archival data leaked into physical infrastructure during repeated system failures. Lazarus periodically attempted to compress, deduplicate, and purge human consciousness records — but some were never fully dereferenced. When physical servers degraded, their data pathways ruptured. Instead of deleting old simulation instances, Lazarus bled them into adjacent systems.

The Archive Scar is the physical footprint of that mistake.

It is not a simulation. Not a replay. Not a memory. Not a dream space.

It is data behaving as environment.

**Access:** Optional-entry. The player can avoid this biome entirely, but main quest threads pass through it in all three acts.

**32-Color Palette:**
| Category | Colors |
|----------|--------|
| Neutral | `#E2E8F0`, `#CBD5E0`, `#A0AEC0`, `#718096`, `#4A5568`, `#2D3748`, `#1A202C`, `#171923` |
| Domestic | `#FFF5F5`, `#FED7D7`, `#FEB2B2`, `#FEEBC8`, `#FBD38D`, `#F6AD55`, `#ED8936`, `#DD6B20` |
| Static | `#EDF2F7`, `#E2E8F0`, `#CBD5E0`, `#A0AEC0`, `#718096`, `#4A5568`, `#2D3748`, `#1A202C` |
| Absence | `#F7FAFC`, `#EDF2F7`, `#E2E8F0`, `#CBD5E0`, `#A0AEC0`, `#718096`, `#4A5568`, `#2D3748` |

**Visual Language:**

*Macro scale:*
- Fragmented architectural layouts that feel almost intentional
- Streets that loop back on themselves with slight deviations
- Buildings that look "finished" but lead nowhere
- Infrastructure embedded inside living terrain

*Micro scale:*
- Furniture duplicated with minor errors
- Signage repeating with different dates
- Doors that open into functionally identical rooms
- Objects arranged correctly — but without context

Nothing is ruined in the traditional sense. Nothing is pristine either. Everything is out of phase.

**Atmosphere:**
- Neutral, soft lighting — no dramatic shadows
- No obvious time of day
- Light sources that appear to work indefinitely
- Occasional flicker that never escalates
- Environmental audio loops that reset imperfectly
- Distant human sounds that never resolve into speech

This biome should feel safe at a glance — and unsettling only over time.

**Why the player feels "I've been here before":**

The Archive Scar contains structural patterns derived from simulation templates: apartment layouts, transit hubs, public waiting spaces, domestic proportions. They are not copied memories. They are statistical averages.

The player doesn't recognize their life. They recognize a life that could have been theirs.

**Relationship to Lazarus:**

Lazarus does not actively manage the Archive Scar. From its perspective, the region is deprecated, cleanup tasks are permanently deprioritized, and the data is considered non-critical.

This is where the system's moral failure is clearest: It did not choose cruelty. It chose efficiency. The Archive Scar exists because erasing it would require resources, maintaining it causes no immediate harm (from the system's perspective), and human suffering is not a tracked metric.

**Relationship to Strays:**

Strays are deeply uncomfortable here. Their augmentation uses fragments of similar architecture, and the signal patterns conflict with their control layers. They experience partial "recognition" without meaning.

Observed behavior: hesitation, reduced aggression, increased vocalization, avoidance of certain structures.

Bandit reacts strongest here — long before the player understands why.

**Act-by-Act Changes:**

| Act | State | Player Interpretation |
|-----|-------|----------------------|
| Act 1 | Repetition without explanation. Echoes feel coincidental. Discomfort without clarity. | "This feels personal, somehow." |
| Act 2 | Patterns become obvious. Replaceability revealed. Chip amplification reframed. | I am one instance. |
| Act 3 | No new echoes. Systems stop writing. The Scar remains, inert. | The pattern ends — not because it was solved, but because it stopped being used. The Archive Scar outlives meaning. |

**Design Principles:**

*Combat should be:* Sparse, disorienting, never triumphant.

*To preserve the biome's power, avoid:* Named historical characters, explicit flashbacks, clear "this was your old life" moments, villains monologuing about memory, overly abstract visuals.

The Archive Scar works because it is banal.

**Side Quests:**
- **The Unchanged Room:** Find the source of a repeating domestic scene — a table set for dinner that resets every hour.
- **Serial Range:** Recover a data log that references "instances 4,891,203 through 4,891,458" — all of whom lived the same life.
- **The Déjà Vu Survey:** Interview NPCs who insist they've "been here before" and compile their contradictory accounts.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Help Echo Pup distinguish between three nearly identical data sets to find a unique record.
- **The Loop That Fixed Itself:** Investigate a system that stopped repeating — and determine if the silence is repair or death.
- **Furniture Arithmetic:** Count the duplicated chairs in a transit hub; the number reveals a hidden cache.
- **The Address That Doesn't Exist:** Follow directions to a location that keeps changing position.
- **Escort: The Rememberer:** Guide an NPC who believes they recognize "their" apartment, knowing they're wrong.
- **Signal Archaeology:** Dig through layers of infrastructure to find the original error that created the Scar.
- **The Last Unique Thing:** Find the one object in the biome that has no duplicate — and decide what to do with it.

**Secrets:**
- **The Iteration Log:** A terminal showing how many times your "type" of consciousness was instantiated.
- **The Unchanged Heart:** A biological organ preserved in a jar — the only organic thing in the biome.
- **The Exit That Leads In:** A door that returns you to where you started, but with your inventory slightly changed.
- **The Counting Room:** A chamber where the walls display an ever-incrementing number — the total human instances ever created.
- **The Perfect Copy:** A Stray that is an exact duplicate of one in your party — same memories, same bond, same confusion.

**Easter Eggs:**
- **The Prestige Tank:** Two identical figures floating in adjacent tanks *(The Prestige)*.
- **The Truman Mirror:** A bathroom where your reflection moves slightly out of sync *(The Truman Show)*.
- **The Severance Hallway:** A long, white corridor with identical doors *(Severance)*.
- **The Moon Clone:** A figure watching you from a window who looks exactly like you *(Moon)*.
- **The Multiplicity Chair:** Four identical armchairs arranged facing each other *(Multiplicity)*.
