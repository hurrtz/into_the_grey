# STRAYS

## Complete Story Outline v3

*by Tobias Winkler*

---

# Core Concept

The protagonist is an ordinary person with one defining trait: he is kind to animals. He has a dog at home — not a special dog, just a loyal companion who loves him. One day, something notices this kindness from across the veil between worlds.

Zsar is a small creature from a parallel realm — a place that exists, but is emotionally barren. The beings there, called Strays, have never known true affection. Zsar watches the protagonist through the thin places between worlds and sees something he has never experienced: genuine love freely given. He wants that. He *needs* that. So he reaches across and pulls the protagonist through.

Now the protagonist is trapped in a world he doesn't understand, surrounded by creatures who crave connection, and the only way home may require destroying everything — and everyone — who brought him here.

A hidden "rebellion counter" tracks player choices throughout the game. No UI element displays this value. The world visually shifts based on the counter:

- **Rebellion-leaning:** Colours become desaturated, then eerie. Shadows deepen. The world feels hostile, watching, afraid.
- **Acceptance-leaning:** Colours warm and saturate. Light softens. The world feels welcoming, gentle, like sinking into a warm bath.

---

# The Stakes

## What Rebellion Costs

- Zsar dies — killed by the protagonist's own party in a pathetic, one-sided slaughter
- All Strays in the world are destroyed
- All villagers (trapped beings from other planes) are freed, sent back to their origins
- The protagonist returns home to his dog

## What Acceptance Costs

- The protagonist stays forever, becoming the new Avatar
- Zsar remains his companion for eternity
- All villagers remain trapped forever
- The dog at home waits, and waits, and eventually dies alone

**The symmetry is cruel:** Zsar saw the protagonist's love for his dog and wanted the same. Now the protagonist must choose between the creature who loved him enough to pull him across reality, and the creature waiting at home who has no idea where he went.

---

# The World

## The Plane Itself

The world is an indifferent ecosystem. It exists. It has self-preservation mechanisms (Watchers). It doesn't "feel" anything. It is not malevolent — it simply *is*. The tragedy isn't that the world needs love. It's that its inhabitants do, and the world itself doesn't care about their loneliness.

## The Strays

Strays are the native creatures of this realm — animal-like, monster-like, but conscious. They crave connection in a world that provides none. Different Strays want different things based on their nature and biome:

- **Suburb Strays** (like Zsar): Closest to dogs and cats. They want affection, companionship, belly scratches.
- **Mountain Strays:** Want someone strong. Someone who can survive. They respect power and endurance.
- **Wilds Strays:** Want community. They seek belonging and social bonds.
- **Ruins Strays:** Want... nothing anymore. They've given up. Some might want meaning, if they can remember what that felt like.
- **Threshold Strays:** Have found peace. They don't want anything — they simply exist in contentment.

## The Villagers

Not all beings in this world are Strays. Over centuries, Strays have reached across the veil and pulled others through — humans from Earth, beings from other planes, creatures from worlds the protagonist cannot imagine. Each was pulled because a Stray wanted something from them.

None of them know how to leave.

They've built villages, established trade, created societies. They go through the motions of life. Some have been here for decades. Some for centuries. Their original worlds may no longer exist, or may have changed beyond recognition.

> *"I was a blacksmith. A Stray saw me working metal and wanted that. Now I'm here, still smithing, for no one in particular."*

The villagers serve as quest-givers, shopkeepers, and craftsmen. They are NPCs in the traditional sense — but they're also victims, trapped souls who remember homes they can never return to.

### Villager Factions

- **Pro-rebellion:** They've heard rumours that destroying the Heart frees everyone. They want to go home. They'll help the protagonist, push him, maybe manipulate him toward rebellion.
- **Pro-acceptance:** They've been here so long there's nothing left to go back to. Their families are dead. This is home now. They fear what rebellion means.
- **Neutral:** Just trying to survive. They'll trade with you either way.

---

# Combat and Threats

The world doesn't need to be actively hostile to be dangerous. Think of it like a wilderness:

## Enemy Types

- **Wild Strays:** Not all Strays want to talk. Some are feral, territorial, frightened, or simply predatory. These are standard encounters. Defeating them opens the possibility of recruitment (if they're the recruitable type).
- **Corrupted Strays:** Strays twisted by the Corruption — a sickness spreading through the world. They attack mindlessly. Cannot be recruited, only put down.
- **Natural Predators:** Creatures that aren't Strays at all. Just hostile fauna of this world. No recruitment possible.
- **Watchers:** The world's immune response. Early game: they respond to disturbance, not the player specifically. Anyone moving too much, making too many ripples, attracts them. Late game rebellion: they target the player directly.

## Path-Based Threats

- **Acceptance path:** The player becomes the world's ally against Corruption. Fighting protects the world. Watchers become neutral or helpful.
- **Rebellion path:** Same enemies, plus escalating Watcher aggression. The world turns its defenses on you.

---

# The Avatar

There are rumours among the villagers of one who tried to destroy the Heart. Someone like the protagonist — pulled in, fought through every biome, made it to the Heart. They were going to destroy it. They were going to go home.

And at the last moment... they couldn't.

Maybe they saw what it would cost. Maybe the world offered them something. Maybe they just broke. Either way, they chose acceptance — and became the Avatar. The world's guardian. Bound to protect the Heart they once came to destroy.

No one has heard from them in many years. They are a legend. A warning. A ghost story told in village taverns.

## The Avatar in Combat

- **Rebellion path:** The Avatar is confident. This is not a desperate last stand — it's a crushing response. They fight to win because they believe they will win. When they fall, they are confused, broken. They made the choice you refused to make. And now you're ending them for it.
- **Acceptance path:** The Avatar is bitter. Resentful. The world has found a replacement. They remember wanting to leave. They chose to stay. And now they're being replaced. The fight is challenging but tinged with melancholy.

# Act Structure

Each act represents one biome with three chapters:

- **Introduction:** Arriving, establishing the biome's tone and threats
- **Exploration:** Side quests, Stray recruitment, world-building, player choice
- **Departure:** Confronting the biome's boss, transition to next area

---

# ACT 1: THE SUBURBS

*Theme: Awakening, Confusion, First Contact*

The suburbs represent the surface layer of this strange world — familiar, domestic, safe in appearance but deeply wrong in substance. Houses with no doors. Streets that loop back on themselves. Lawns that are too green, too perfect, too still.

The protagonist doesn't question any of this. Not really. He notices oddities, files them away, keeps moving. It's easier to focus on immediate survival than to ask why the sky is the wrong colour or why he can't remember how he got here. Zsar encourages this —

> *"Don't think too hard. Thinking makes ripples. Just walk. Just explore. It's nice here, isn't it?"*

## Chapter 1: Introduction — "Nowhere"

The protagonist awakens on a small lawn. No memory of how he arrived. No understanding of where "here" even is. He remembers his name. He remembers... a dog. Waiting for him. Somewhere.

He stands. The grass is soft beneath his feet. The sky is pale, the colour of old paper. Around him: a suburb. Cookie-cutter houses. Driveways with no cars. Mailboxes with no names. Everything is still. No birdsong. No distant traffic. No voices. Only wind moving through leaves that don't fall.

**Gameplay:** Tutorial zone. Basic movement, interaction, inventory. No combat yet. Building atmosphere and unease.

## Chapter 2: Exploration — "The Watcher in the Garden"

Something is following him.

Then, in a backyard overgrown with grey weeds, he meets Zsar.

Zsar is small, furred, with too many eyes and a voice like wind through broken glass. He speaks directly into the protagonist's mind. He is curious, cautious, but ultimately desperate for connection. He explains that the Watchers are the world's way of enforcing stillness. They hunt anything that disturbs the stasis.

> *"I've watched you. From far away. I've watched you be kind. To the small one with four legs. You loved it, and it loved you. I wanted... I wanted that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I brought you here. But I couldn't help it. I needed someone who could love."*

This is the first hint of why the protagonist is here. Not fate. Not destiny. Just a lonely creature who saw kindness and wanted it for himself.

Soon after, a minor Watcher notices them. Zsar engages it, and with the protagonist's help, defeats it. From its remains emerges another Stray that was trapped inside — the protagonist's first recruitable companion.

### Side Quests

- **"Something in the Basement"** — A Stray hides in a house's basement, terrified of Watchers. Help it escape or leave it to its fear.
- **"The Crying Mailbox"** — A mailbox makes sounds at night. Investigate to find a Stray trapped inside as a warning.
- **"Too-Green Lawn"** — One lawn is impossibly vibrant. A Stray is buried alive, sustaining the grass with its life force.
- **"The House That Remembers"** — One house has photos on the walls with smudged faces. Exploring triggers a brief flashback — a dog's bark, warmth, then nothing.

## Chapter 3: Departure — "The Sentinel"

As the protagonist tries to leave the suburbs, the Sentinel appears — a Watcher that has claimed this territory. A towering figure of suburban debris. Lawn chairs for ribs. Garden hoses for veins. A mailbox for a head.

> *"You just got here. Sit down. Have some lemonade. Stay forever. Forever. Forever."*

**Boss mechanics:** The Sentinel attacks with weaponized domesticity — hurled lawn darts, strangling garden hoses, waves of white picket fence spikes. It tries to trap rather than kill.

**Transition:** The protagonist and Zsar leave the suburbs behind. A road appears leading up into mountains that weren't visible before. The world has expanded because the protagonist forced it to.

---

# ACT 2: THE MOUNTAINS

*Theme: Expansion, Growth, First Warnings*

The mountains represent the protagonist's drive, his need to push forward, to overcome. But beneath that drive is something rawer: frustration. The comfortable numbness of the suburbs is gone. Now the protagonist *wants* answers, and the world refuses to provide them.

Zsar is different here. Less certain. He admits he doesn't understand how the world can have places he's never seen.

> *"I thought I knew everything. I thought there was only the neighbourhood. But you walked out, and now there's... more. Did you make this? Or was it always here, waiting?"*

## Chapter 4: Introduction — "Ascent"

The road climbs steeply. The protagonist encounters other Strays — not hostile, but wary. Unlike Zsar, these Strays are not eager to help. They speak of the Corruption — a spreading rot that infects Strays, turning them hollow and violent.

The first villager appears here. A weathered human sitting by a fire. They've been here for decades. They explain, briefly, how this world works: Strays pull people through. No one knows how to get back. Most stop trying.

## Chapter 5: Exploration — "The Sickness and the Stone"

The mountains are vast. The Corruption is visible now — black veins spreading across stone, infected Strays that attack mindlessly. The protagonist learns that the Corruption isn't foreign; it's the world eating itself.

**The first artifact appears:** In a cave, half-buried in snow, the protagonist finds something that doesn't belong. A strip of leather. A collar. A small tag with a name on it — his dog's name. Objects from home, bleeding through.

> Zsar is disturbed. *"Don't touch those. They're from... somewhere else. They shouldn't be here. Neither should you, but you are, and that's different."*

## Chapter 6: Departure — "The Hollow"

At the heart of the mountains, where the Corruption is thickest, the protagonist finds its source: a Stray called the Hollow.

The Hollow was once like Zsar — curious, alive. It asked questions too. It demanded answers. And when meaning never came, it broke. Now it is empty. The Corruption came from within.

> *"I fought. Like you're fighting. I screamed at the sky. And do you know what answered me? Nothing. Nothing at all. So I stopped. And the stillness was such a relief."*

**Boss mechanics:** The Hollow doesn't attack aggressively. It drains. It debuffs. It makes the protagonist's Strays lethargic, slow, sad. The battle is about maintaining the will to fight.

---

# ACT 3: THE WILDS

*Theme: Community, Belonging, The Vision*

The Wilds represent the protagonist's need for connection. After the harsh isolation of the mountains, the Wilds offer something seductive: community. Strays everywhere — talking, arguing, playing. Villages of trapped beings from other worlds. A place where the protagonist could fit in.

## Chapter 7: Introduction — "Among Others"

The forest is dense, green, impossibly alive. Strays have society here. The protagonist feels something loosen in his chest. After the emptiness and struggle, this is... relief.

A proper village exists here — built by generations of trapped beings. Shops. Taverns. Craftsmen. The protagonist can buy equipment, take quests, hear stories of others who came before.

Some villagers whisper about the rumour:

> *"They say if someone breaks the Heart, we all go back. But no one's ever done it. Most who try just... disappear."*

## Chapter 8: Exploration — "The Dreamer's Echo"

Strays whisper about a place called the Echo — a clearing where the world is "thin." Older Strays forbid going there.

**The Echo:** Eventually, the protagonist must visit. Deep in the forest, the trees thin. The clearing shows something impossible:

A room. His room. Rendered in bark and stone and vines, but unmistakably his apartment. And there, curled on a pillow that isn't quite right, is a shape. Small. Four legs. Waiting.

His dog. Waiting for him to come home.

The protagonist reaches out, and —

He wakes in the forest. Zsar is shaking him. The clearing is gone. But the protagonist knows now. He has something to go back to. Someone waiting.

> Zsar won't talk about it. *"Forget it. That place doesn't exist. Please. Let's just go."*

## Chapter 9: Departure — "The Rot Mother"

The Rot Mother was once the oldest Stray in the Wilds — a great tree-being who sheltered generations. Now she is sick. She doesn't want to hurt anyone. She wants to die. But the world won't let her.

> *"I have been here so long. I watched everyone grow. I loved them. But I'm tired now. I'm so tired, and I can't stop."*

**Boss mechanics:** The Rot Mother spawns corrupted offspring — twisted versions of the Strays she once nurtured. The battle is melancholy, not triumphant.

---

# ACT 4: THE RUINS

*Theme: History, Truth, The Choice*

The Ruins represent the collapse of all defenses. The protagonist can no longer deny, fight, or bargain. The Echo showed him his dog waiting. The world spoke to him. Everything here is heavy.

## Chapter 10: Introduction — "What Remains"

The Ruins are the corpse of a city that never existed. Buildings that don't match any architecture. Signs in languages that look familiar but can't be read.

Zsar walks beside him in silence. For once, he doesn't try to fill the quiet.

> *"I don't like this place. It feels like... like giving up feels."*

## Chapter 11: Exploration — "The World Speaks"

Deep in the Ruins, the world speaks. Not through a Stray. Just... a voice. Everywhere and nowhere.

> *"I know that if you leave, something ends. I don't know what. I know that I don't want it to end. Is that selfish? Am I allowed to want things?"*

### Zsar's Confession

Zsar asks to speak. His usual energy is gone.

> *"I brought you here because I was lonely. Because I saw you with your dog and I wanted that. I didn't think about what it would cost you. I didn't think about whether you'd want to stay. I just... took. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."*

He curls up beside the protagonist.

> *"Whatever you decide... I'll be here. Until I can't be anymore."*

## Chapter 12: Departure — "The Echo"

The boss of the Ruins is a reflection. In the deepest part, the protagonist finds a mirror showing him as he was — at home, with his dog, before Zsar pulled him through.

> *"You came all this way, and you still don't know what you'll choose. Accept the new life, or destroy everything to reclaim the old one."*

**Boss mechanics:** The Echo mirrors the protagonist's party. It copies abilities, counters strategies. The battle is fundamentally against yourself.

---

# ACT 5: THE THRESHOLD

*Theme: Commitment, Sacrifice, Ending*

*Aesthetic: Fiddler's Green — pastoral paradise*

The Threshold is not what the protagonist expected. After everything... this. Rolling green hills. Golden light. Gentle wind. Perfect peace.

This is where the mind goes when it stops fighting.

## Chapter 13: Introduction — "The Green"

**Rebellion-leaning:** The paradise is bittersweet. Every perfect meadow, every gentle breeze — all of it will end because of what he's chosen. He walks through beauty he's about to destroy.

**Acceptance-leaning:** The paradise is welcoming. This is where he'll spend eternity. The weight of the journey lifts with each step.

**Point of No Return:** Before the final hill, there is a gate. The game prompts: *"Beyond this point, your path is set. Save now if you wish to return."*

## Chapter 14: Exploration — "What Must Be Paid"

### Rebellion Path

The moment the protagonist crosses the threshold, Zsar understands. This is the end of everything.

Zsar stops walking. For a long moment, they just look at each other.

> *"I can't let you do this. I know I can't stop you. But I have to try. This world — it's all I have. And you're going to kill it."*

He attacks.

The protagonist's party reacts on instinct. Five Strays — leveled to the ceiling, augmented with the best gear — move to protect their master.

Zsar is level 1. He has no augmentations. No gear. No growth.

**The fight lasts seconds. It's not a boss battle.** Just a small Stray who believed in something, torn apart by monsters who believed in someone else.

### Acceptance Path

The road reveals a final Corruption — the protagonist's own guilt, trauma, and self-hatred made manifest. The battle is against his inner demons. Zsar fights alongside him.

> *"I'm glad you chose this. I'm glad we get to stay together."*

## Chapter 15: Departure — "The Heart"

The protagonist enters the Heart. At the centre stands the Avatar — the world's guardian. Someone who came before. Someone who couldn't go through with rebellion.

**Rebellion:** The Avatar is confident. *"I am everything the world can muster against you. And I will not fall."* The fight is brutal — the hardest in the game.

**Acceptance:** The Avatar is bitter. *"So. The world has found someone new. And I am to step aside gracefully?"* The fight is challenging but melancholy.

---

# EPILOGUE: "Home"

## REBELLION

Light. Blinding. Then darkness. Then...

He's standing in his apartment. It's exactly as he left it. The same furniture. The same mess. The same everything.

And there, by the door, is his dog. Tail wagging. Confused but happy. Alive.

He drops to his knees. The dog rushes to him. He holds it tight and doesn't let go.

He's home.

But he remembers everything. The suburbs. The mountains. The Strays. Zsar — small and warm and loyal, standing in front of him knowing he would die, dying because the protagonist wouldn't stop.

He is home, and everyone he loved in that other place is dead because he chose this.

The villagers are free. Somewhere, across a thousand worlds, people are waking up in places they forgot existed, finding their way back to lives that moved on without them.

Was it worth it?

The screen fades. The answer is left to the player.

## ACCEPTANCE

Golden light pours from the Heart. It washes over the protagonist like a wave. He feels himself changing. Not dissolving — *becoming*. Stronger. More. The light lifts him, reshapes him, remakes him into something new.

He is the Avatar now. The world's guardian. Zsar looks up at him with something like awe.

> *"You're... you're beautiful."*

He turns from the Heart and walks into a realm beyond the Green. Zsar follows, small and loyal, as he always has.

The screen fades to gold.

Then:

A montage. Silent. No music. Just images.

The protagonist's apartment. A neighbour opens the door, concerned. Finds the dog alone. Takes him in.

The dog sits by a window. Waiting.

Seasons change outside. The dog grows grey around the muzzle. Still waiting.

Years pass. The dog is old now. Slow. Tired. But every day, he goes to the window. Watches. Hopes.

One day, he doesn't get up. He lies in a patch of sunlight, eyes half-closed, facing the window. Still waiting. Always waiting.

He never stopped believing his owner would come home.

The protagonist will never come home. He chose eternal paradise. The dog chose eternal faith.

The villagers remain trapped. Forever.

Was it worth it?

The screen fades. The answer is left to the player.

# Key Design Notes

## Emotional Arc

Each act carries a distinct emotional weight that mirrors stages of processing displacement:

- **Suburbs:** Numbness, avoidance, refusing to look too closely
- **Mountains:** Frustration, confrontation, demanding answers
- **Wilds:** Negotiation, seeking belonging, desperate deals
- **Ruins:** Heaviness, exhaustion, collapse of defenses
- **Threshold:** Resolution, readiness, the end of internal struggle

## The Rebellion Counter

- Hidden from player — no UI element
- Each quest affects counter by varying amounts
- Visual world state shifts gradually
- Zsar's dialogue reflects counter state throughout
- Soft locks at thresholds: certain quests only appear once committed

## Stray Recruitment

Recruitment is never automatic:

1. **Defeat the Stray in combat** — prerequisite
2. **Ask if it wants to join** — the Stray chooses
3. **Meet the conditions** — based on Stray personality and biome desires
4. **Once beaten, the fight doesn't repeat** — return when conditions change

Strays may decline because: party too strong/weak, too many/few Strays, alignment mismatch, rebellion/acceptance counter thresholds, missing items, or incomplete quests.

## Zsar's Arc

- **Role:** Companion, not combatant. Always present, never in active battle party.
- **Guilt:** He knows he stole the protagonist from his life. This weighs on him.
- **Growth:** None. He stays level 1. He was never meant to fight.
- **End:** Rebellion = pathetic death defending his world. Acceptance = eternal companion.

## The Avatar's Identity

A previous person who was pulled through, fought through every biome, made it to the Heart — and couldn't go through with destruction. They chose acceptance and became the world's guardian. Now they face the protagonist: someone making the choice they couldn't.

## Villager Dynamics

Villagers are trapped beings from other planes. They provide:

- Shops and equipment
- Quests and lore
- Rumours about the Heart and what destroying it might do
- Moral pressure — some want rebellion, some fear it

---

# Open Questions

- How do flashbacks mechanically trigger? (Specific locations? Artifacts? Random chance?)
- Full Stray roster and evolution paths
- Detailed quest designs and rebellion counter values
- What artifacts look like in-game (objects from home bleeding through)
- Music and sound design for path differentiation
- How much do villagers know about the rumour? Who believes it?
- Does the Avatar remember who they were before?
- What happens to villagers during the rebellion finale? Do they witness the destruction?
